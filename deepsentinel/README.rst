I'm seeking a startup R&D job that be responsible for the core technology.
I believe this one is what I'm looking for and I can handle it.

I'm a high qualified Python programmer, love Pythonic philosophy that
solving problem over fashion technology; about software development,
I desire close cooperation for "time to market",
and understand how to work with agile framework.

Not only development, I also have experience in feature design, UI/UX improvement
test automation, CI management, building development environment and infrastructure.
I try anything making production successful.

Work is part of life, I'm accelerating to solve problem.
Although there are key domain knowledge in this job I'm not familiar with yet,
I will study and leverage community to carry on quickly.
