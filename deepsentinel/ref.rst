About this Job

We are seeking awesome experienced (preferably 5+ years) Full-stack Back-end Engineers to join our small team in building a truly next-generation home security system utilizing all the killer bells and whistles: deep learning, hybrid-cloud, big data, etc. We are a tight-knit, fast-paced, high energy start-up team. Our ideal candidate has a passion for code, a love for a fail-fast (and work freaking hard) engineering environment, and a hunger to learn and grow. We prefer raw-intelligence over syntax-excellence, ownership over silos. And coffee over water.

Because we are a small team, this role will span all areas of our tech stack: deep learning development/tuning/integration, web services, data pipeline management, protocol hacking, packet packing/unpacking, robotics, data analysis, deployment/qa/continuous integration management. Key elements of our stack are Python 3.x on Ubuntu 14.x. Our favorite development tools are github (of course), and docker. We use Jenkins for CI, MySQL and SQLite for our (pretty minimal) RDBMS needs. We aren’t afraid to peel back the covers and work on our open-source components to patch them and we contribute back to the community whenever we can.

Responsibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Core development:
    Developing webservice endpoints, and business logic to support a kick-ass UX and the testing necessary to ensure that it JustWorks (™) for the consumer

Protocol and Streaming packets hacking:
    Our engineering team deal with streaming protocols like RTSP, RTP, and wireshark dumps a lot. Going deep into these protocols and packets and hacking them inside out is something we do from time to time.

Computer Vision and Deep Learning:
    Oh, the hottest topic nowadays. If you are an awesome engineer and wish to tap into the computer vision and data science world, you are in the right place. CNN/RNN and different NN architectures are just something we play every single day.

Product ownership:
    Build new data features from end-to-end: ideation, api specification, development, testing, integration testing and iteration.

Work as a team:
    Collaborating with backend, mobile developers, hardware engineers, data scientists, and CUSTOMERS (yes, you got it right) to polish the existing awesomeness and build new features to build new features

DevOps and Performance:
    Optimizing servers for scalability, efficiency and maintainability

Code quality:
    Helping us measure, maintaining and improve our code quality

Minimum Qualifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deep understanding of Computer Science fundamentals (OOP, data structures, algorithms)

Familiar with at least one of the following programming languages: python, ruby, scala, java. We use python. A lot. So if you don’t like it, you should probably move on along.

The Start-Up mentality: The right candidate considers herself/himself to be a “get-er-done” type of person and is looking to have a huge impact at a small company. Hard work is a must, so the right person exudes positive life-giving energy from solving hard technical problems, working hands-on in the code and doing things other people consider impossible. We’re going to keep the team super small for the time being (lean startup mode FTW) so you’ve gotta be willing to roll up your sleeves and do everything from dev to devops to architecture to QA to IT/OPS. (PS Good news–the whole team will be like this too, and that’s the best type of team to be on.)

--------------------------

Our stack

python + data + deep learning + react native

We’re developing in Python and our stack includes deep-learning back-end (SQL/Hadoop + caffe/Theano/TensorFlow), data pipeline, react-native for our apps, and just starting to work on web development.

It’s a bonus point if you are comfortable with C/C++ and python extension, you have remarkable computer vision background, or you love to read h264, rtp, RTSP, specs, or wireshark dumps before you go to bed every single day.
