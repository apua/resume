Personality

        Live simple, enjoy the little things.
        Work for the benefits of all but person.
        Less desire to buy fashion product (eg: smart phone).
        Love helpful and stable technique more than fashion technique.

Career Goal

    I want to focus on projects rather then change goals frequently.

    I hope I have lots of chance to discuss with colleague and collaboration, so that I can get partner and accumulate developing experience.

Expectation

    Though I finish all courses in NCTU, I don`t write my paper yet. I would get academic degree after I handle my job (next year, perhaps).

    After work, I plain to go to opensource group and join opensource projects. There are some products I want to implement, so I need to contact more people and learn more technique.
